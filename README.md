# liri-node-app

This is a basic search app that has three functions:

It searches movies using the OMDB API using the terminal command "movie-this"
It searches songs using the Spotify API using the command "spotify-this-song"
It reads a file (random.txt) and executes the command written within using the command "do-what-it-says"

Images demonstrating these commands and their output are here: https://github.com/zcsocal/liri-node-app/tree/master/images
